# 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques

This repository contains my programming implementations and experiments from the **Machine Learning Techniques (MLT)** course in the BS in Data Science & Applications program at IIT Madras.

The purpose of this repository is to maintain a structured record of practical understanding — every notebook corresponds to an algorithm or concept implemented and explored during the course.

## 🗂 Repository Organization

The repository is organized by topic rather than by assignment week.
Each folder contains implementations, experiments, and observations related to that concept.

Typical contents:

* algorithm implementation
* verification experiments
* small datasets and analysis

## ▶️ Running the Notebooks

### Google Colab

Open the notebook and run all cells — no installation required.

### Local Environment

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd machine-learning-techniques-iitm
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

## 🎯 Objective

This repository serves as:

* A reference implementation set for core machine learning algorithms
* A revision resource for concepts and derivations
* A demonstration of applied understanding through code
