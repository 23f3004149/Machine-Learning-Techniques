# 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques — IIT Madras BS Degree

A curated collection of implementations, derivations, and experiments from my **Machine Learning Techniques (MLT)** course.

This repository is maintained as a **proof of understanding** — every notebook documents not just the final solution, but the reasoning process behind the algorithm.

---

## 📘 About This Repository

Instead of treating assignments as one-time submissions, I maintain them as a growing technical notebook where I:

* implement algorithms step-by-step
* verify results mathematically and experimentally
* compare theory with actual behavior
* build intuition through small experiments

The goal is long-term mastery, not short-term completion.

Each topic generally contains:

* concept explanation
* implementation
* experimentation / observations

## 📌 Current Notebooks

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* Mathematical intuition behind dimensionality reduction
* Eigenvectors as directions of maximum variance
* Projection to lower dimensional subspace
* Practical implementation and verification

---

## ▶️ Run on Google Colab

You can open any notebook directly in Colab and run all cells.

No setup required.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

I follow a simple rule:

> If I cannot implement an algorithm from scratch, I have not learned it yet.

So most notebooks:

1. Implement algorithm manually
2. Validate using libraries (NumPy / sklearn)
3. Experiment with edge cases
